<section id="overview" >
    <p>The Northeast Chapter of <a href="https://womeninhpc.org/" target="_blank">Women in High Performance Computing (WHPC)</a> was established in October 2023 and are looking to expand our representation! We’re interested in welcoming members of diverse professional backgrounds who are involved in any element of Research Computing and Data at your organization.

    <p>Members of the Northeast WHPC chapter benefit from activities that focus on:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Bringing visibility to the Research Computing career track and raising awareness about the variety of entry points, career paths, and specialty areas within the field.</li>

        <li>Functioning as a peer network for career advice, self-advocacy, and mentoring.</li>

        <li>Providing chapter members and their local communities with programming on topics that empower women in Research Computing and Data and address common challenges.</li>

        <li>Hosting social and support events and inviting guest speakers to present on their research, experience, or trials and tribulations of being a woman working in this field.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This spring the chapter has been meeting monthly for group discussions and peer mentoring on topics such as how to introduce yourself in different contexts and sharing exciting projects we are working on.</p>
